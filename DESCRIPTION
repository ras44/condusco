Title: Query-Driven Pipeline Execution and Query Templates
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Roland Stevenson
Maintainer: Roland Stevenson <roland@rmg-services.com>
Description: Runs a function iteratively over each row of either a dataframe 
    or the results of a query.  Use the 'BigQuery' and 'DBI' wrappers to 
    iteratively pass each row of query results to a function.  If a field 
    contains a 'JSON' string, it will be converted to an object.  This is 
    helpful for queries that return 'JSON' strings that represent objects.  
    These fields can then be treated as objects by the pipeline.
